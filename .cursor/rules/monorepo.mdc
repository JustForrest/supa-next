## Monorepo Standards
- Follow consistent patterns across applications and packages
- Don't duplicate code that could be shared
- Use workspace references for cross-package dependencies
- Abstract common UI elements to shared libraries
- Maintain clear module boundaries
- Always use pnpm for package management in monorepo context
- Use pnpm workspace commands for cross-package operations (pnpm --filter)

## Package Standards
- Clear, descriptive exports
- Comprehensive TypeScript types
- Minimal external dependencies
- Version compatibility across workspace
- Use named exports for better tree-shaking
- Use pnpm scripts for consistent command execution
