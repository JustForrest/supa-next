## TypeScript Standards
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define explicit return types for non-trivial functions
- Create dedicated interfaces for complex object shapes
- Avoid using 'any' type
- Use generics appropriately
- Leverage TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit)
- Write strongly-typed functions and components

## Type Definitions
- Keep types and interfaces close to where they're used
- Export shared types from dedicated files
- Use discriminated unions for state management
